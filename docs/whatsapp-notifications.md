# WhatsApp Appointment Notifications

This document explains how to set up and use the WhatsApp appointment notification system for the Voice Agent application.

## Overview

The WhatsApp notification system sends appointment confirmations and reminders to users via WhatsApp. It integrates with the existing Voice Agent workflow to provide a seamless experience for users.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- n8n installed and running
- WhatsApp Business API account
- MongoDB database configured

### WhatsApp Business API Setup

## Workflow Structure

The WhatsApp notification workflow consists of the following components:

1. **Webhook Trigger**
   - Listens for incoming requests from the Voice Agent workflow
   - Path: `/webhook/appointment-notification`

2. **Intent Processing**
   - Branches based on the notification type (confirmation, reminder)
   - Each branch handles a specific type of notification

3. **Data Retrieval**
   - Fetches appointment details from MongoDB
   - Fetches user details from MongoDB

4. **WhatsApp Messaging**
   - Sends formatted WhatsApp messages to users
   - Customizes the message content based on the notification type

5. **Webhook Response**
   - Sends a response back to the Voice Agent workflow

## Integration with Voice Agent Workflow

The Voice Agent workflow has been updated to trigger WhatsApp notifications when:

1. A new appointment is created
2. An appointment is rescheduled
3. An appointment reminder needs to be sent
